Rumor has it that people spend more time on social media during holidays. Does this fact apply to Twitter? Companies certainly don’t miss the occasion for advertising their products. So how many people are in danger of seeing something they really want to buy and almost definitely don’t need? Let’s look at the data. 

In order to reduce the noise of the initial twitter data we decide to group all tweets by week across all years (2006 - 2014) and normalize it using the amount of active egos per week. The two following plots show the weekly average tweet per user count and the number of active unique users per week.
